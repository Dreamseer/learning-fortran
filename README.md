> You can measure a programmer's perspective by noting his attitude on the continuing vitality of FORTRAN. - Alan Perlis

Everyone is doing fucking ES2017, Go, and other fancy shit.
But this is just me learning [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran).
Move along, dude. :wave:

## Required stuff

You need [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for compiling FORTRAN programs.

On macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) run:

```bash
$ brew install gcc
```
